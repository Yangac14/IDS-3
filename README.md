# IDS-3

## requirements
for the commands that execute within the vm, several things need to be in order:
guest additions needs to be installed in the vm, this can be done through the devices menu > insert guest additions
the vm must be considered a linux vm in virtualbox, that is, under operating system in virtualbox, it should be set to a linux distro, or other linux 64bit
the root password needs to be set. by default since the main account has admin privilages, the root password hasn't been set. do "sudo passwd root" to set.
